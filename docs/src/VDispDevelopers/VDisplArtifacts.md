# Old Functions

The `VDisp` program has kept in some of the old functionality of `VDispl`, like parsing the old input file format and directly writing to an output file. The functions assisting with this process are still available for any future contributors or curious developers to play around with and are listed below:

```@docs
vdisp.readInputFile
```
