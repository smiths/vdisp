# VDisp Documentation

## Overview

`VDisp` is a one-dimensional soil settlement analysis software created to aid undergraduate civil engineering students in their studies of geotechnical engineering. It is created using the `Julia` programming language, and `Qt/QML` markup language for the front-end GUI.

## Installation and Execution

Detailed installation and execution instructions for `VDisp` and `Julia` can be found under the Installation section of the [VDisp Wiki Home Page](https://github.com/smiths/vdisp/wiki#running-your-first-simulation-using-vdisp) and the [VDisp Wiki Getting Started With Julia Page](https://github.com/smiths/vdisp/wiki/Getting-Started-with-Julia#installation).
