`VDisp` is a software designed to perform one-dimensional soil settlement analysis using calculations and approximations commonly seen in an undergraduate Geotechnical Engineering courses taught in Canadian universities. It was based on the `VDispl` program found in Appendix F of the 1994 publication, [Settlement Analysis](https://www.publications.usace.army.mil/Portals/76/Publications/EngineerManuals/EM_1110-1-1904.pdf).

`VDisp` was developed using the `Julia` programming language, and `Qt/QML` for the user interface.

## Installation and Getting Started

## What is Project.toml

When working with Julia, a Project.toml file is the way to describe your project. This is where you list dependencies, authors, compatibility constraints, etc. Check [the Julia documentation page](https://pkgdocs.julialang.org/v1/toml-files/) for more info.
