# .data Directory

This directory is where `VDisp` stores some information about the users preferences. These files are left out of the GitHub version control, and are automatically generated by `VDisp`.

The manual editing of these files is *highly* discouraged, and should only be done by individuals who know what they are doing.

## .units

The first file is called `.units`. This is where `VDisp` stores the user's last selection for unit system. This file simply contains one line that either says *"Metric"* or *"Imperial"*. It is **case-sensetive**.

## dir.dat

The second file is called `dir.dat`. This is where `VDisp` stores the last directory from which the user selected an input file. This file can be left blank to let `VDisp` default to the users **home** directory.
